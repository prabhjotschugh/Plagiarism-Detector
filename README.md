# Plagiarism Detector
• It is an Artificial Intelligence Project used to detect plagiarism between various documents. 

• The program collects a list of source texts (assumed to be in .txt format) and tokenizes them using the TF-IDF vectorization method.

• It then computes similarity scores between each pair of documents using both Cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity. If the similarity score between two documents is above a pre-defined threshold, it prints a message indicating that the documents are plagiarized. 

• Finally, the program prints a similarity table indicating the similarity scores between all pairs of documents. This code can be useful for checking plagiarism in academic papers or other types of documents.
